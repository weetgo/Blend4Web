"by using the \"compressed_gzip\" :ref:`URL parameter "
"<webplayer_attributes>`. To do this in a custom application, one should "
"pass the \"assets_gzip_available\" flag in the :b4wref:`app.init` method."
" Compressed files can be generated by the Project Manager command "
"\"convert resources\". However, GZIP-compressed resources should be used "
"only if it's not possible to set up such compression on a server. More "

"<gzip>`."

msgid "LOD system improvements."
msgstr "LOD系统改进。"

msgid ""
"From now on LOD level switching can be performed smoothly by using alpha "
"test, which makes the transitions less noticeable. The corresponding "
"option is called ``LOD Smooth Transitions`` and can be tuned in the "
"``Scene -> Object Clustering & LOD`` panel. Keep in mind that enabling "
"this for all objects can significantly reduce application performance."
msgstr ""
"从现在开始，可以通过使用alpha测试来平滑地进行LOD层次切换，这使得转换不太明显。相应的选项称为 ``LOD 平滑切换`` ，可以在 "
"``Scene -> Object Clustering & LOD`` 面板中调用。请记住，为所有物体启用此功能可能显着降低应用程序性能。"

msgid ""
"Also, a new option called ``Max LOD Hysteresis Interval`` has been added."
" Its intent is to eliminate continuous LOD switching when the camera "
"moves near the border between 2 LOD levels. This option replaced the old "
"``LOD Transition Ratio`` parameter from the ``Object->Levels of Detail`` "
"panel."
msgstr ""
"此外，还添加了一个名为  ``Max LOD Hysteresis Interval`` "
"的新选项。其目的是为了消除当相机移动到两个LOD之间的边界附近时连续的LOD切换 。该选项从 ``Object->Levels of "
